# TweetCSVAnnotator

This is a basic utility developed in 2021 for my capstone project at UVA Wise. The utility was developed using Swift and it allowed our development team to quickly annotate CSV files filled with several hundred Tweets pulled from Twitter. We later used these annotated CSV files to train a hate-speech detection algorithm.
